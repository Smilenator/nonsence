# nonsense
This is a script that create nonsence text files similar to input text files.

How to use:
1. Put your example files in the directory `input/`
2. Run the script in console with the command `python nonsense.py <num>` where optional param <num> is the level of the nonsence. Higher level means a result will be more similar to the source files. The examples of "Alice in Wonderland" have level 4. The default value is 1.
3. Find the result files in the directory `output/`. They will have the same file names and nonsense inside.
